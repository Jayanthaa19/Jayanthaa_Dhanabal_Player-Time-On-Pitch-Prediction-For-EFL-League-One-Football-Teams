This project presents a predictive modelling tool designed to forecast the number of minutes professional football players are likely to play in competitive leagues such as EFL League One. Using a two-pronged data approach, the model combines publicly available event data from StatsBomb with private club information on fitness, training, and performance ratings from Lincoln City FC. The pipeline integrates preprocessing, feature engineering, and a range of machine learning algorithms, with LightGBM achieving the highest accuracy (88.34% variance explained). SHAP feature importance analysis was applied to improve interpretability, enabling stakeholders to understand the key drivers behind predictions. The system demonstrates practical applications for squad rotation, recruitment, and contract decisions while ensuring GDPR compliance, anonymisation, and fairness. It provides a flexible baseline for future integration with live data, injury risk metrics, and tactical analytics across different leagues and sports.
