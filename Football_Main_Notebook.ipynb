After applying the function, it performs an analysis of the enhanced dataset and visualizes player progression patterns to understand the impact of the new temporal features.

    "\n",
    "This cell addresses the critical issue of data leakage that was identified in the previous steps. It first loads the enhanced dataset, then explicitly identifies and removes features that were directly derived from the target variable ('player_season_minutes'), as these can lead to unrealistically high performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing the leakage features, it prepares the clean data for modeling by handling categorical variables (using one-hot encoding or label encoding based on the number of unique categories) and ensuring only numeric features remain for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is then split into training, validation, and test sets. A RobustScaler is applied to the numeric features to handle potential outliers. Finally, a Gradient Boosting Regressor model is retrained on this *clean* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell concludes by evaluating the retrained model on the validation and test sets, providing realistic performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R², MAPE). It compares these realistic metrics to the inflated metrics from the leaky model, highlights the top important features from the clean model, and interprets the performance for business context. The corrected model, scaler, and feature names are then saved for future use."
